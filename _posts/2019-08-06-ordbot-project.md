# Ordbot project

I have written a short post on the build and history of my Ordbot Hadrod 3d printer.

It's currently in pieces awaiting a complete overhaul after 6 years of service, which seemed like a good time to finially get around to putting up some posts on it.

Check it out [here]({% link _ordbot/ordbot.md %})
