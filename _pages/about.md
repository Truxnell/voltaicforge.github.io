## .. the site

A website for me to post progress on my projects, reviews, teardowns and whatever else takes my fancy in the realm of computers and electronics.  I've wanted to get a website up for my hobby projects for a while, and having found the ideal platform to write its time to do it!

I'm interested in many things, generally revolving around computing and electronics which will find its way here.  I generally don't want to spend time discussing things you can search for easily (as I assume your google-fu is strong).  However, I will post on ideas or challenges that are unique, as well as the projects I have on the go.

## .. me

I'm a 30 something Aussie that works as a supply chain planner in my profession life.  If I'm not spending time with my family or friends, I'm generally found tinkering with a computer or electrical project.

## ... powered by

I've settled on using [AWS][AWS] as a host, which is plain _awesome_ added in with [Jekyll][Jekyll].  This gives a nice static site, which is then lightning fast to serve almost anywhere on any server with almost no overhead.

Finding the right technology was a challenge.  I don't have oodles of time to spend maintaining more technology and platforms than I already have setup, and the Internet (as a generalization) has become so bloated with javascript, HTML5, flash ads and whatnot It's been a challenge to find a nice, simple clean tech to be able to just _write_.  Remember when the content of sites was king?

## ... the domain name

I'm not good at names.  I tried for a while to figure out a decent name for the blog, and I will let you be the judge as to if I have failed or succeeded.  I aimed to pick a somewhat descriptive word to describe what I would be writing about, that was somewhat unique and sounded good.

I came up with VoltaicForge with far too much thesaurus perusing.  ``Voltaic`` is a synonym for electrical, exciting, and _stimulating_ (apparently).  When I saw the word I just knew I wanted it for the title.  I felt this captured the nature of the niche I would be discussing.

I stumbled around a lot because I don't like the word ``blog`` much and I wanted a second word that described the creative nature of what I do.  ``Forge`` came up as a synonym of ``Create`` and who doesn't like the imagery of toiling over a hot forge, smithy hammer in hand, striking mighty blows to perfect their craft.
