# What does a brew day look like?

It was another Sunday recently, another day to brew some beer. I figured why not take a few pictures to demonstrate what a All-Grain, eBIAB brew day looks like?

It can be really confounding to get into homebrewing 'properly' with all grain when in reality and it really can be quite simple and cheap. I started off small after some time doing extracts, and making the jump to all grain was dauting at the time.

What follows is an example of my average brew day which puts out beer with no issues.

## Recipe design





## Yeast Starter (3 days prior)

*A yeast starter is almost a small brew, with the aim to take the store-bought yeast package and allow the yeast to propergrate.  This gives a brewer the oppourtunity to pitch 250 or more billion healthy yeast cells when starting fermentation, instad of the 100 billion or so often in a pack.  Can also assist with older packets of yeast which may have much less viable yeast left*

While not critical, it's pretty common for many brewers to spin up a yeast starter prior to brew day.  Not nessicary for dry packaged yeast, but useful for liquid yeast, a yeast starter helps ensure a healthy number of yeast are picthed ready to go the moment they are put into the fermenter.

This may sound like a normal packet isn't enough for a brew.  A store-bought packet will work and make beer - however it will take longer for the yeast to propergate in the fresh wort.  Experience shows it may be days for single pack of yeast to 'get going', where a yeast starter can be fermeting strongly within hours.
Quicker fermentation reduces the risk of any bacteria that may have ended up in the beer taking hold - a large active population of active yeast will stifle other growth, which is definietly what we want to have happen.

Here I build a DIY stirplate from a computer fan, ebay PWM fan controlller, magnets and a 3D-printed base.  With a sanitised 1L conical flask, a rule of thumb is to put 1L of pre-boiled water chilled to room temp, mixed with 100g of Dry Malt Extract (DME).  A simple sanitised peice of aluminium foil is suffiecient over the top - this allows the CO<sup>2</sup> to escape but minimises particular matter easily getting in.

Then simply use the stir plate and leave it for a few days, while the yeast consume the sugar and multiply.

## Mill Setup equipment (1 day prior)

The night prior I setup the equipment and check a few things.

It's always best to check the ingredients before getting started with the brew!  I grab the recipe sheet and check that I have everything - especially hops and yeast.

Then its onto having the workspace ready to go.  I setup my urn in a central, slightly raised spot and attach a hoist above it.  The hoist helps lift the grain out of the urn when needed as it can be quite heavy once it soaks up water.

I grab my foodsafe water hose and fill the urn with the required amount of water for the mash step as per the recipe, confirming
